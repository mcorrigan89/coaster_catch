      <p class="text-block">
        The goal of Coaster Catch is to be the last player to successfully flip
        and catch their ever-growing stack of coasters.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="header">HERE'S THE CATCH...</div>
    <div class="copy-group">
      <p class="text-block">
        To perform the flip, begin with your stack of coasters hanging off the
        edge of the table. With your palm facing down, tap the stack upwards
        with the back of your extended fingers. Allow the stack to flip 180
        degrees and catch it between your thumb and fingers as shown.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="header">THE SETUP</div>
    <div class="setup-group">
      <p class="text-block">
        1. Find a surface with a hard edge to play on. Surfaces with rounded
        edges are not recommended.
      </p>
      <p class="text-block">
        2. It's helpful to spend at least a few minutes practicing flipping and
        catching a coaster, especially for new players. Once everyone is
        comfortable with the maneuver, continue setup.
      </p>
      <p class="text-block">
        3. Each player starts with three (3) Lifelines.
        <br />
        <span class="text-italic"
          >Note: To shorten play time or increase difficulty, you can start with
          fewer Lifelines.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p class="text-block">
        4. Shuffle 100 coasters and place them facedown in a stack at the center
        of the play area. This will be the Community Stack.
      </p>
      <p class="text-block">
        5. Pick a player to go first using any method you like. The direction of
        play begins clockwise.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="header">TURNS</div>
    <div class="copy-group">
      <p class="text-block">
        Start your turn by taking a coaster from the top of the Community Stack
        and adding it to your Personal Stack.
      </p>
      <p class="text-block">
        There are two kinds of coasters, which will determine how to proceed:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="sub-header">Blank Coasters</div>
    <div class="copy-group">
      <p class="text-block">
        The player simply adds the coaster to their stack and flips to end their
        turn.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="sub-header">Action Coasters</div>
    <div class="copy-group">
      <p class="text-block">
        The player must perform the action displayed on the coaster before
        flipping their stack to end their turn. <span class="text-italic">If you do not have enough
        coasters required to perform the action, the coaster is treated as
        blank. Any coasters picked up as the direct result of an action are
        treated as blanks.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="text-block">
        The turn ends with the player flipping and catching their Personal
        Stack. If the player is successful, it is the next player's turn. If a
        catch is unsuccessful, that player must remove one Lifeline and end
        their turn. When a player fails to catch their stack and they have no
        more Lifelines in their possession, they are out of the game.
      </p>
      <p class="text-block">
        <span class="text-italic">Note: For questionable catch attempts, group consensus determines if it
        was legal or not.</span> The game continues until one person remains in the
        game.
